### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Paul Sadauskas](https://blog.theamazingrando.com), and usually go by TheAmazingRando on the internet. I love Ruby :ruby: and have been a Rails developer since there was a Rails (deployed my first application on 0.11 in 2005). I was a member of the DataMapper and Merb core teams, and have contributed to many open-source projects (both Ruby and non-Ruby) over the years.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [Scalar.sh](https://scalar.sh) â€” A tool to autoscale servers with a simple configuration.
  - [Logsnarf](https://logsnarf.com) - A tool that receives your logs and write metrics to your TSDB.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and woodworking.
